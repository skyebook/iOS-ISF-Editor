\ingroup VVBufferPool
VVBuffers are the basic unit produced by VVBufferPool- each buffer typically represents an image of some sort- usually a GL texture.  VVBuffers are almost always pooled as they are freed so they may be re-used to minimize having to delete/recreate GL-related resources.

VVBuffers conform to the NSCopying protocol, but this behavior isn't straightforward- while calling "copy" on an instance of VVBuffer will result in the creation of another VVBuffer instance, both buffers refer to the same underlying GL resource (the same texture, for example).  If you want to actually duplicate a VVBuffer- if you want to create another GL texture with the same contents- you need to use the VVBufferCopier class.
